A sandwich makes a wonderfully convenient meal. However, its simplicity means that some people slap any filling between two pieces of bread and call it a day. If you want to learn how to make a better sandwich, you’ve come to the right place. Follow our top 10 tips for making sandwiches and start creating your own masterpieces.

## 1. Use Quality Ingredients

To make your own tasty sandwich, you have to start with tasty ingredients. Opting for high-quality meats, cheeses, toppings and condiments will ensure your sandwich looks and tastes its best. The next time you take a trip to the grocery store or the farmer’s market, you’ll want to pick up an array of fresh ingredients to build the ideal sandwich:

- Get your meats freshly sliced at the deli counter.
- Skip the presliced, packaged cheeses for artisan alternatives in the cheese section. The extra preparation will be worth the flavor of an aged cheddar from a local farm.

> Be sure to grab whole vegetables like tomatoes and romaine lettuce to slice up for your sandwich.
> Let your tastebuds determine the best sandwich toppings and make sure they’re the best quality you can find.

## 2. Incorporate Sauces and Spreads

Once you have your quality ingredients, it’s time to consider the sauces and spreads. The right condiments will take your sandwich to a whole new level. If you’re looking for a change of pace from the condiments you typically add to your sandwiches, try making your homemade versions. Replacing your plain mayo with homemade lemon dill mayonnaise can elevate a sandwich all on its own.

> Here are a few of the best sandwich condiments you might like to try:

1. Chipotle mayonnaise
1. Dijon mustard
1. Hummus
1. Tzatziki
1. Fruit jam
1. Pepper jelly
1. Barbecue sauce
1. Pesto

## 3. Remember to Add Vegetables

Sometimes your cravings can only be satisfied by a ham and cheese sandwich. When you’re considering the characteristics of a good sandwich, though, vegetables are an essential part of the puzzle. Whether you prefer a few dill pickle slices or some caramelized onion, your vegetable choices can help your sandwich taste fresher and lighter.

> If you’re looking to add a new vegetable to your sandwiches, you may want to try:

1. Lettuce
1. Spinach
1. Tomatoes
1. Pickles
1. Onions
1. Avocado
1. Sprouts
1. Olives
1. Peppers
1. Mushrooms
1. Coleslaw

## 4. Keep Proper Pairings in Mind

**For example**, a creamy brie cheese, spicy pepper jelly and cured salami sandwich tastes delicious thanks to the marriage of sweet, hot and spicy flavors. Slices of honey ham, sharp cheddar cheese and spicy whole-grain mustard on [premium wheat bread](https://www.goldmedalbakery.com/product/wheat-bread/24oz-premium-wheat-bread/) make a great-tasting arrangement.

> Consider how well your sandwich ingredients work together as you compile it, and take the chance to experiment!

## 5. Get Creative With Cheese Options

There are dozens of different types of cheese to browse at the supermarket. Swapping out basic slices for a hunk of finely-aged cheese can make a significant difference in your sandwiches. If you’re looking for more choices than your local grocery store has to offer, you may want to head to a specialty cheese shop where you can sample various kinds until you find the right one for you.
